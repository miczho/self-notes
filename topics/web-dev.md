# The Big Idea

In simplest terms, the **Internet** is a network of computers that commuicate with each other using standardized protocols.

The **World Wide Web** is a service that runs on the Internet. It's a system of interconnected documents and resources shared between computers.

Other Internet services include but aren't limited to:
- email
- file transfer
- instant messaging
- media streaming

Whereas the Web typically communiates via HTTP, these services will sometimes use different protocols. [The next section](#02) will talk more about protocols.

## Computer Categorization

Computers can be categorized as users and/or servers.

**What is a server? How is it different from a client/user?**  
A server is a computer that provides resources to other computers.  
A server, serves. A user, uses.

Software running on the user computer is considered **front-end**  
Software running on the server computer is considered **back-end**

Front-end logic includes:
- websites
- apps

Back-end logic includes:
- data processing & storage
- business logic
- task scheduling / background processing

Serving content can take quite a bit of computing power, so the above diagram can be expanded to this:

# Network Protocols

Communication Protocols - HTTP, TCP/IP, SSH

## Future Topics

localhost and ports

REST APIs  
APIs can be web-based (like RESTful APIs over HTTP) or local (like libraries or frameworks)

Front End Frameworks - React, Vue

Static vs Dynamic vs Responsive Site:

Static Websites, also known as fixed websites are the most simplistic websites which contains web pages which with fixed content. This means their content do not change depending on the user. Static websites are built using simple HTML code and display same information to every user. The codes are fixed for each page so the information provided on the page does not change unless it is manually updated. Generally, static websites are cheaper and easier to create. Resizing the browser or viewing it on different devices won’t affect the way website looks. These websites have a set width and require horizontal scrolling.

Dynamic Websites, also known as fluid websites contain dynamic web pages that are generated in real time. This means that the web pages will display different content each time the site is visited. These pages include web scripting code, such as PHP or JS. Dynamic pages access information from a database. Hence, webmaster may only need to update the database record in order to alter the content of dynamic pages. Unlike Static websites, dynamic websites have more personal and interactive user experience. These websites takes slightly slower time to load in comparison to Static as they are little more complex to develop. Dynamic websites looks same in terms of proportions no matter what the screen size.

There is another type for websites which is widely used these days. The websites which are built with percentages instead of exact measurements. These websites are called as Responsive Websites which are optimised for smartphones and tablets. Responsive websites used actually look different on each device. The elements stretches or shrinks according to the screen size. These websites are built using a mobile-first approach. A large proportion of the users use mobile phones to view the site. Therefore, most of the companies nowadays opt for responsive web design services, whether they work on small scale or large as it offers best experience to such users.
