# General Issues

Issues that persist regardless of distro:

### Lid Switch Detection

Issue(s):
1. Lid is not detected as closed when I close the laptop.
2. When I hook up the laptop to a monitor and switch to 'External Only' mode, the lid switch fires excessively between 'open' and 'closed' during suspend. This wakes the computer.
    - May have to reconfirm this through logging. Command is `journalctl --since '{YOUR_VALUE} {minutes/hours} ago' | grep -i ' lid '`
    - *\*Update\** PROBABLY NOT TRUE

It's not worth enabling lid events if either of these do not work.

*\*Solution\** Disable lid events. Changes made:

GNOME Tweaks installed with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`. 'Suspend when laptop lid is closed' is set to 'off'.

The `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` file has original settings changed to:

```conf
# /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/custom-logind.conf

[Login]
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
```

The `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf` file has original settings:

```conf
IgnoreLid=false
```

Changed to:

```conf
IgnoreLid=true
```

\*NOTE\* Ignoring the lid switch does not mean it's not fired.

When the computer is locked, it automatically fires a `lid close` event, which disables all on-board devices (trackpad & keyboard).  
This can be an issue when no external input is connected.
- *SOLUTION: SET THE POWER BUTTON TO `do nothing` WHEN PRESSED. USE POWER BUTTON TO WAKE FROM LOCK.*

### Unexpected Wake From Sleep

Issue(s):
1. Laptop in suspend wakes by itself. Sometimes immediately, sometimes after 1+ hours.

*\*Solution 1\** Disable wakeup from USB

It's suspected that one or more of the devices listed from `cat /proc/acpi/wakeup` is triggering this.

```sh
$ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup

Run `sudo nano /lib/systemd/system-sleep/device-wakeup-disable` and paste this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# /lib/systemd/system-sleep/device-wakeup-disable
#
# Avoids that system wakes up immediately after suspend or hibernate

case "$1" in
  pre)
    for device in XHC TXHC; do
      if grep -qE "^$device.*enabled" /proc/acpi/wakeup; then
        echo "Disabling wakeup on $device" 
        echo "$device" > /proc/acpi/wakeup
      fi
    done

    # Loop through each USB device directory in /sys/bus/usb/devices/
    for device_dir in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/; do
      # Check if the directory contains a power/wakeup file that is enabled
      if [ -e "$device_dir/power/wakeup" ] && 
         [ "$(cat "$device_dir/power/wakeup")" = "enabled" ]; then
        # Disable wakeup for the USB device
        echo "Disabling wakeup on $(basename "$device_dir")"
        echo disabled > "$device_dir/power/wakeup"
      fi
    done
    ;;
  *)
    ;;
esac
```

Then run `sudo chmod +x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/device-wakeup-disable`

Run these commands to check if all devices are disabled:
- `grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/product` shows all USB devices
- `grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup` shows which ones are allow to wake

*\*Solution 2\** [Disabling wake-on-lan](https://askubuntu.com/a/1459436) in NetworkManager config

> You can disable Wake-on-LAN for all connections permanently by adding a dedicated configuration file : /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wake-on-lan.conf

Create the file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wake-on-lan.conf
```

Then paste the following into the file:

```conf
[connection]
ethernet.wake-on-lan=ignore
wifi.wake-on-wlan=ignore
```

Press `Ctrl+O` to save the changes and then press `Ctrl+X` to exit

*\*Solution 3\** Custom sleep config

```conf
# /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/custom-suspend.conf

[Sleep]
SuspendMode=platform standby
```

 Deprecated in Fedora 40

 Misc useful commands:
 - `echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/power/pm_debug_messages`
 - `sudo journalctl -k -f`
 - `sudo dmesg -w`

# Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS Tweaking

### Apple AirPods Pro Connection Failure

Issue(s):
1. AirPods won't connect.

Airpods don't work on Bluetooth Low Energy and Dual-Mode so we have to force all devices to use Bluetooth BR/EDR (Classic Bluetooth).

Changes made to `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`:

Original setting:

```conf
#ControllerMode = dual
```

Changed to:

```conf
ControllerMode = bredr
```

Once changes are made, run `sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart` *WITH BLUETOOTH TURNED OFF*.

## General

Use `flatpak` for installing consumer apps, `dnf` for dev apps.

Suspend (Modern Standby/S0ix/S2idle) only works under airplane mode. Consider getting the wifi card replaced? Or wait until Fedora fixes.

`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/device-wakeup-disable` also added (see Pop!_OS).
